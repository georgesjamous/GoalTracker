Code Hints
  I usually dont advocate extensive commenting. However on this occasion i over explained my intentions in some areas. 
  You can find these areas by searching for the string `Note:` in the code.

<br>

Code Todos: 
  marked with `todo`. Usually we replace those with `#warning` to keep us from forgetting.
  Some people like to use SonarQuebe to break when it finds totdos, i dont like that.
