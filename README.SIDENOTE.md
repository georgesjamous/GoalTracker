# Goal Tracker
### Side Note

Things I wanted to do but did not have time for:

    1- Logging service
    2- I wanted to implement Goal Pagination and Batching
    3- I wanted to implement Proper HealthKit Authorization Check and UI
    4- I wanted to implement Trophy Gain Alert when someone gains trophies
    5- More testing
    6- Implement protocols on models instead of structs (referred to in Discussion Section)
    7- Clean the code a bit
    8- Use SwiftGen for Localization
    9- Use SwiftLint for linting and sanitization

What i spent most of my time on

- Apple HealthKit:
  it has been a while since i worked with heakth kit, it took me some time to go through the docs and implement the ProviderLibrary

Opinion on code challenge:

    Challenge is interesting although requires more time than a Weekend (2 Days).

    Since its basically a functional Application with a purpose, i often found my 
    self in the MVP dilema where on one side, i wanted to finish the user journey, 
    and on the other i wanted to write clean and separated code for _reader_ to understand.

    So it took some time to balance the two.
